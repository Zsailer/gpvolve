    """Computes the fixation probability between two 1D arrays of fitnesses or two single fitnesses.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fitness1 : 1D numpy.ndarray(dtype=float).
        Fitnesses of the first node of all edges. Fitness of genotype that the population is homogeneous for.

    fitness2 : 1D numpy.ndarray(dtype=float).
        Fitnesses of the second node of all edges. Fitness of genotype that "tries" to get fixed in the population.

    population_size : int.
        Population genetics parameter that is inversely proportional to the level of genetic drift.

    Returns
    -------
    fix : 1D numpy.ndarray(dtype=float).
        Returns array with all fixation probabilities of the system in the order defined by fitness1 and fitness2.

    Notes
    -----
    The mathematical function is not robust to the case where two fitnesses are identical(division by 0 error).
    This python function checks for such cases and adds a 1.000.000ths of the second fitness value to itself in order
    to marginally unlevel the two fitnesses. Note that, although unlikely, this might effect evolutionary trajectories
    in an unpredictable way.
